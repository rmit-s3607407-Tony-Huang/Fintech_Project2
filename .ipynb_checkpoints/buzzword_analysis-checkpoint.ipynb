The WannaCry hackers also took their Bitcoin ransoms and converted them into Monero for good reason. They knew that if they used any other currency, it would be blacklisted by the markets and their assets would be frozen. (This has already being done with other cryptos by the way, such as Ethereum. One of the hackers who stole ETH from an ICO a month or so ago had their funds blacklisted.)\n",

There are tens of trillions of dollars hidden overseas; the exact amount varies depending on what source you look up. Those dollars are not going to want to be on a fully transparent blockchain.

To be honest, BitPay should stop with that SegWit2x nonsense and support Bitcoin cash instead. Since most miners signed the NYA for 2x, only the few miners left will be on the 1m chain and the 1m code doesn't have the difficulty reset code that BCH included.

      "I've explained several times how we market XRP to that payment flow. Essentially, you find a goldilocks payment corridor that's not incredibly efficient but has enough volume to be worth it.

Its use resulted in SW being activate now, and in november it gives 2MB blocks though HF. But many of Core supports (including Thyemos) don't want 2MB part. They want only SW. Thus they censor everything related to 2MB hf part, hopeing that lack of information will results in 2MB HF not happening.

The article disagrees with these assertions and discusses the possible flaws in the researcher's perspective, concluding that a Bitcoin standard would have immense staying power because it reforms central banks from market regulators into market competitors. In such a situation, money markets become more broad, independent of regulators and subject to market competition. It won't be long before Bitcoin has anything to do with you.

For example, if 30% of the hash power jumped over, they'd find blocks in about a minute, this would result in about 750 of BCH mined an hour. Since the motivation for the switch was more money and not philosophical, they'd probably be selling most of that, which would put ~18000 BCH on the market each day pushing the price back down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I doubt there'd be much of a switch by the big pools, due to the possible risks related to such speculation and the affect it might have on their longer term profits of Bitcoin.\n",

      "Edit: grammar Forking and maintaining the original vision is an attempt to continue Bitcoin, not destroy it. The more you deny this, the worse it will get. In my opinion your trust has been abused.  Sorry that this has happened.  Many of us have tried to fight against the situation to prevent this happening.  I don't have all the answers, but at least when I write something on this forum it, for better or worse, stays visible and is ranked in a sensible manner.  Censorship, at the very least, shows a lack of respect for people being able to read and judge things for themselves.  At worst, as in the apparent case of the other reddit forum, it is used to control people's opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of this needed to happen.  Bitcoin could have forked to a larger blocksize years ago in a unified manner and none of that would have prevented R &amp; D on second layer solutions (but it would have proven that there was no need to rush into them).\n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully you have not lost out financially. If a small group of people can come along and make the necessary changes that are long overdue (larger blocks), and the market responds favorably, it means it was a needed change and bitcoin is working as expected. \n",
      "No one \"took over\" anything, they just presented the market with an alternative, and if the market adopts it, so be it I was thinking about messaging Theymos and telling him how much I'm enjoying watching the whole thing unravel. It's been amazing. It's also been so exciting to watch Bitcoin Cash and see the conversations around here start to feel like the Bitcoin I remember: merchant adoption, usage, and all that. &gt; I don't give two shits who the people are, just what the code is\n",
      "\n",
      "That's true in theory, but in practice a big chunk of the users don't have the ability to meaningfully look at the code. We mitigate that problem essentially through a very complex social system of layers and layers of experts, journalism, and social media. That system isn't perfect, and one of *it's* vulnerabilities is people misrepresenting themselves. So creating an environment where misrepresentation is corrected is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, that's one of the main reasons why I've been discouraging journalists and conference organizers from saying I'm a \"Bitcoin Core Developer\". While I've contributed a lot more than Jeff Garzik has in the past few years, I haven't contributed any significant code changes for at least a year, and while I've done some peer review, lots of others have done more; currently I'm mostly focused on research. I'm in a professional and social position where I can definitely afford to *not* be called a \"Bitcoin Core Developer\", so I've decided to use that as an opportunity to set a good example.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, I got the upcoming [Breaking Bitcoin](https://breaking-bitcoin.com/) conference to change my title from \"Bitcoin Core Developer\" to \"Applied Cryptographer\", and have also gotten many journalists to have their articles describe me with phrases such as \"[Longtime Bitcoin developer and researcher](https://coinjournal.net/effects-bigger-bitcoin-blocks-mining-centralization-debated-state-digital-money-event/)\", \"[bitcoin protocol researcher](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/03/21/is-this-massive-power-struggle-about-to-blow-up-bitcoin/#3cfd9a157325)\", \"[cryptography researcher](https://www.coindesk.com/who-broke-the-sha1-algorithm-and-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin/)\", etc. Of course, lots of people still choose to say I'm a \"Bitcoin Core developer\" - including the official [CoreDev.tech](https://coredev.tech/nextmeeting.html) event organized by Bitcoin Core itself -  but that's their choice, not mine.\n",

Some new stickied thread could be something like \"MUST READ: A brief history of censorship on /r/bitcoin, the corporate takeover of Bitcoin by Blockstream/Core and the reasons for Bitcoin Cash\". As a bystander, it really feels like a huge change on r/btc after the split. Before, it felt like there were some interesting thought points and argumentation about the direction of bitcoin and I found it a place to read reasonable counter-arguments to what I read here.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now it really does feel like a cult and it's getting harder to justify why I'm still subscribed. The vitriol is really concerning. Bcash was never an issue. Although I think that it's based on stupid ideas, I've been pretty supportive of the effort (eg. I mentioned it neutrally in all of my ultra-high-profile posts on the matter), and I encourage bigblockers to use it, promote it, and try to compete with Bitcoin that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real issue is bait-and-switch stuff like B2X, BU, XT, etc., which tries to *trick* people into giving up their individual sovereignty. This kind of thing will constantly be happening; the powers that be want very badly to co-opt or destroy Bitcoin. If/when B2X is defeated, I'm sure that the next attempt will be right around the corner. But although victory is not *guaranteed*, Bitcoin does have an innate resistance against being corrupted. The \"best-case scenario\" for B2X supporters is that they will create the biggest catastrophe in Bitcoin history, involving weeks of effective downtime, millions of dollars in lost BTC, lawsuits against basically every site which holds user BTC, and at the end of it they will have tricked a slim majority of the economy into using their currency via bait-and-switch on big sites, while the remaining economy supports only the real Bitcoin as a thorn in their side forever. I tend to think that big sites like Coinbase are not *quite* so incompetent that they will fail to realize this before it's too late. So I think that B2X has a substantially lower probability of \"success\" than XT did when that takeover attempt was conducted, though we should never become complacent.\n",

      "Even in the very-unlikely worst-case scenario described above, Bitcoin can definitely survive. Plans are already in place, code written. It would be a very annoying ordeal, however, and a major setback. Bitcoin is starting to become a religious thing. Disagreement over some specific thing means a whole new denomination is created.\n",

      "**Bitcoin Cash pros:**\n",
      "A big argument for Bitcoin Cash is that because it allows for much larger blocks than Bitcoin Core, this will allow greater throughput (~24tx/sec max) &amp; less backlog as well as lower fees. This lets Bitcoin Cash scale more and their argument would be it is more useful for peer to peer, for commerce and just everything. Additionally it does not include Segregated Witness (SegWit) (which some view as a positive since some see SegWit as less secure or having legal issues).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bitcoin Cash cons:**\n",
      "Against Bitcoin Cash we have arguments like it is more centralized due to small less well known development team and due to fewer people running Bitcoin Cash full nodes and higher cost to run a full node. It does not (yet) solve transaction malleability (SegWit) and so existing Lightning Network (LN) implementations won't be run on top of Bitcoin Cash at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bitcoin Core pros:**\n",
      "Established large development team, robust network of nodes (less centralized), transaction malleability fix (SegWit) allows current Lighting Network to run on top of it. SegWit allows for double the existing transaction throughput of the current Bitcoin Core limit of ~3tx/sec to ~6tx/sec max once enough people are using SegWit style transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bitcoin Core cons:**\n",
      "Even with SegWit transaction throughput is limited. Centralized control of development from Blockstream and very small group of prominent devs that effectively have control over changes. Some toxic developers.  SegWit some believe is less secure or can lead to problems (this is of course highly disputed). Reliance on unproven solutions like LN to increase throughput/scale beyond block size limits. \n",

At the same time, today in fact, Core officially stated that they do not recognize SegWit2x fork as valid (https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/08/18/btc1-misleading-statements/), failing to caution the public that SegWit2x = 95% of Bitcoin mining power. This, in turn, \"helps\" the SegWit2x project to confirm their decision to move forward with the fork (in case any miners had doubts). SegWit2x fork IS happening, this is a fact (https://segwit2x.github.io/segwit2x-announce.html). \n",

      " Nice job, Roger. I also like to point out that the *entire purpose* of money is to *reduce* transactional friction.  Consider that people don't really trade goods and services for money; they ultimately trade goods and services for other goods and services.  Money is simply a medium of exchange, i.e., a tool to facilitate the exchange of \"real\" value by circumventing the extreme inefficiency of direct barter.  Deliberately increasing transactional friction via an arbitrary capacity constraint--making transacting slower, more expensive, and less reliable--is a direct attack on Bitcoin's money property and value proposition. Expanded thoughts: [Three ways an arbitrary capacity limit harms Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6emrtd/three_ways_an_arbitrary_capacity_limit_harms/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage).

      "PayPal for virtual goods is usually a bad idea. The reason for this is that it's very easy for someone to claim they did not receive their goods and to charge back. If you sold $9000 of skins in one go and then they charged it back, they just got a payday of $9000. \n",

      "So my advice would be to look into options. Read guides from people on the best ways to sell. Never sell to anyone who tries to rush you. You can probably afford a middleman to help with the transactions. Look their reputation up. Always triple check things to make sure you aren't accidentally giving it to some random person. \n",

      "As far as payment method goes, bitcoin is outside of my familiarity so I can't speak to any pros or cons to that.  I don't know why I bother. I went to Twitter (first mistake) and started reading some of Vitalik's tweets. Then I got sucked into one thread of them because the Bitcoin maximalists were showing their true form with ad hominem attacks woven into poorly thought out responses. So I decided to respond to one of them. Big mistake. It's like arguing with a wall made of bricks, because they lack any rational thought. Ended up just wanting to physically destroy things in my house thanks to their childishness and the frustration of not being able to have a rational, level headed debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "This brings me to sort of a \"common sense\" epiphany. With all technological advancement, you have adopters and you have resistors. Adopters are the people whose personality allows for them to see the value in change, the value in innovation, without loyalty or allegiance to something out of social pressure or over investment. Resistors are the people that do not see other options, are overly invested in the status quo either emotionally or financially, or have succumbed to social pressures levied on them by other resistors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it's the typewriter &gt; word processor &gt; personal computer, or land line &gt; cellular phone &gt; smartphone, most technology has seen the same resistor vs adopter dynamic in their early days. Though probably not quite as public and open a battle thanks to the increasing presence of social media. This is no different for blockchain technologies / cryptocurrencies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin was the first... everyone who adopted it or accepted it fought (and are still fighting) the resistors of that time claiming \"it has no use!\" or \"centralized systems are better!\" or \"that technology will never catch on.\" The community rallied to prove the naysayers wrong, and that created a huge social camaraderie. That coupled with people making big time investments created many loyalists heavily vested in Bitcoin's ultimate success. Those are the individuals who would ultimately become the resistors. Those that need that social camaraderie (a sense of being a part of an exclusive inner circle), or those that are over invested in Bitcoin's success (financially or emotionally).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now enter alternative blockchains and more feature rich blockchains like Ethereum. Those resistors are so blinded by their need to keep the the status quo, and protect what they're overly invested in that all of these \"new shiny things\" become an instant competitor and threat to their interests, even with apples to oranges use cases or intended functionality. Meanwhile, as all new innovation does, Ethereum and the alts have amassed their adopters, just as Bitcoin once did, and they're found defending their new ventures from the Bitcoin resistors. It's a natural cycle in the technology realm. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I would like to point out as the main takeaway here is, you're never going to change someone's mind that resides in the mindset of a resistor once they choose to take on that position. It is a choice, whether they believe so or not. By that point they NEED the status quo to persist from an emotional, and probably financial point of view. The good news is, the history of technological innovation shows that resistance really is futile. Innovation generally wins out once it has the adopters. Then resistors reluctantly, or are forced to, adopt, though usually much later and at a much higher \"cost\" than early adopters.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with all that said, the Ethereum community, other successful alt communities won't have to put up with Bitcoin maximalists forever if history holds true, and so long as Ethereum continues to be successful and gaining adoption. However, with that being said, someone is essentially going to have to deal with Ethereum maximalists just the same, because such is the cycle of technology resistance and adoption. With any technology's success comes the overly invested loyalists and with them the resistance to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR:** Resistance to innovation and advancement is natural due to vested interests, but resistance is ultimately futile when innovation fuels mass adoption. Bitcoin maximalists will learn a cold hard lesson in missing the boat one day. Just as any technology related maximalists fighting to keep the status quo and prevent further innovation do. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Still TL;DR:** **Don't be a maximalist!** Fun fact: Bitcoin Cash currently has market cap equal to what Bitcoin had in December 2016.  Shit is getting real. There is nothing wrong with transaction malleabiltiy.  Its not an issue at all, what problem can malleability cause?  You were fed a false narrative.

Their censorship has no place in Bitcoin. As they say, \"there is a sucker born every minute.\" Bitcoin and all it's aspects have been an amazing break through in human history in several respects. But once you go beyond the surface it can become complex and hard to understand everything and how it all comes together. So sometimes it's easier for humans to just depend on others to think for them and just blindly follow who they believe is right. I'm not completely surprised that people follow Tone and others, as it's easier to be ignorant than it is to think for yourself.  I have like 0.0003 bitcoin (it was like $3 donated to me from a person on Reddit that converted to btc)which is now apparently worth a whopping $16.71. I can now retire.

One side likes the idea of Bitcoin as it has been until now. It is called Bitcoin Cash and somewhat religiously follows Satoshi's vision (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). To alleviate backlog of transactions and rising fees, they implemented increase of blockhain blocks from 1MB limit to a new, larger 8MB limit. My analogy is to recall email attachments early on. They were limited to a few MB at first, then 10MB, 20MB, up until 25MB on Gmail which then started using 3rd party Google Drive internally.\n",

      "The other side says Bitcoin cannot work with such scaling approach of pre-meditated MB increases and wants to jump to the internal 3rd party processor right away, without any MB increase. Due to the controversy and current backlog of transactions and already high fees, this was later compromised to a 2MB increase in addition to the internal 3rd party processor implementations. But the 1st side mentioned above didn't accept it and that's why they created the Bitcoin Cash fork. The other side stuck with Bitcoin (now referred to as Bitcoin Core to avoid confusion) and there are some indications that they will abandon the 2MB compromise, possibly seen as redundant. Of course, not all parties who stuck with Bitcoin Core agree and another Bitcoin Core fork is anticipated later in November (https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-is-splitting-once-again-are-you-ready) and the \"Outcome #2: Segwit2x reneges on 2x or does not prioritize on-chain scaling\" seems to be on track (https://blog.bridge21.io/before-and-after-the-great-bitcoin-fork-17d2aad5d512). Bitcoin Core wants to change the system to 3rd party networks (lightening networks on SegWit = segregated witness). They are getting quite political and some even imply $1000 fees (https://cointelegraph.com/news/ari-paul-tuur-demeester-look-forward-to-up-to-1k-bitcoin-fees) whereas Bitcoin Cash intends to keep small fees around 0-5 cents with larger volume being processed in larger blockchain blocks.\n",

Both sides don't care about decentralization at all. Not trying to spread FUD, I'm just tired of this crap. Great article.

      "**Background**  \n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin has 'consensus rules'.  These are rules that are enforced by every node on the network; a transaction or block that does not follow consensus rules will be rejected.  These rules include things like how Bitcoins are created, how the difficulty of mining blocks is set, etc.  So if I wanted to mine a block with 0 difficulty that gave me a block reward of 999999BTC, I could do this, but every other node and miner would reject my block because 1. my block reward does not follow consensus and 2. my difficulty does not follow consensus.  Thus my block would be ignored and orphaned.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Changing consensus rules is difficult.  If you release a new software version with different consensus rules, the people on the new version will be running different rules than the people still on the old version.  That can create a fork- where the network splits in two, and each side ignores the other side's blocks because they violate the consensus rules and are thus invalid.  Thus changing consensus needs agreement from a large majority of the network, and the change must be planned in order to avoid forks.  More on that a bit later.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Several years ago, back when Satoshi was still with us, he added a consensus rule that blocks can be no more than 1MB in size.  At the time, blocks were under 100KB so hitting 1MB blocks was years away.  This was designed as a sort of last ditch spam filter- if someone wanted to spam the network, this would at least rate limit how much crap they could pump into the Blockchain.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It was pointed out that we'd eventually hit 1MB blocks.  Satoshi suggested a simple way around this- a 'flag day' upgrade.  Flag day is where you pick some future time and say 'at this moment, everybody switches from old consensus rules to new consensus rules'.  So you pick some date several months or years away and say 'as of that date the new block size is 2MB'.  As long as you do this well in advance, nobody will notice the difference.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Satoshi disappeared.  He left Gavin Andresen as head maintainer of the Bitcoin-core code project.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Gavin however didn't want to coordinate development, he wanted to write code.  So he stepped down from that post and Wladimir van der Laan took over.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Wladimir adopted the policy that changing consensus rules requires a full consensus with overwhelming support for the change.  This was all fine, except a few prominent Bitcoin developers didn't think the block size limit should be raised.  They felt that we should hit the block size limit and have full blocks, creating a situation where only the highest fee transactions confirm and the rest are rejected.  They felt this was a good thing because 1. having smaller blocks makes it easier to run a full node and thus increases decentralization, and 2. increased transaction fees from transactions fighting for block space will be better in the long run for miners.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Since there was no consensus, per Wladimir's policy the consensus rules did not change.  This left a few people like Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn fighting for a change, but never getting it.  This situation persisted from ~2012 to ~2015.  \n",

      "**Bitcoin XT**\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2015, Gavin and Mike decided that Core's development process was broken, and a new approach was needed.  So they created another Bitcoin software called Bitcoin-XT.  XT was based on the original Core code, but it had one major change- miners who run it tag their blocks as being XT blocks.  Once a high enough % of blocks have the XT tag, a countdown starts, and once that countdown ends the consensus rules change and the block size is raised to 8mb, doubling every two years after that.  This would allow a 'safe' consensus rule change.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This as you can imagine created a lot of debate and argument within the Bitcoin community.  However that came to a head when Theymos, who ran both /r/bitcoin and the bitcointalk web forum, decided that XT was a hostile attack.  He instituted a new policy that since XT was not compatible with Core's consensus rules, it was not actually Bitcoin, and thus should not be discussed or promoted on his Bitcoin forums.  \n",
      "Now I've been in a lot of online communities for a long time, and I have never seen a community split so hard, so fast.  Immediately fans of XT accused Theymos (and by association, Core) of censorship.  Core fans accused Gavin/Mike/XT fans of trying to subvert a democratic process and maliciously take over Bitcoin.  It got really, really ugly, and /r/btc was created for people who supported XT and otherwise raising the block size limit.  XT adoption started to increase.  There was some debate among miners, who were both 1. not ready to abandon Core and Core's developers, and 2. thought maybe 8MB was too much.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the DDoS attacks started- some unknown person started flooding all XT nodes with garbage data, knocking them off the Internet.  This kicked a great many XT nodes offline, and was the beginning of the end for XT.  After a few months, Mike Hearn 'ragequit', writing a long blog post saying he thought Bitcoin as a whole had failed and he was moving on to other things.  \n",

      "**SegWit**  \n",
      "\n",
      "Around this time, Core developer Pieter Wuille came up with an alternate proposal called Segregated Witness (SegWit).  Since most of the space in the block is used by transaction signatures ('witness data'), Pieter suggested moving that data outside of the block into a secondary data 'backpack'.  Through some formatting hacks, existing Bitcoin nodes would see the transaction as a valid transaction (but couldn't verify the signatures), while SegWit nodes would see the external signature data and fully verify the transactions.  Because this left a potential vulnerability, SegWit had an even higher activation threshold of blocks than XT did.  \n",
      "\n",
      "SegWit was controversial.  Opponents point to the fact that a non-SegWit node will see a SegWit transaction as not having signatures, thus it's an 'anyone can spend this' transaction.  Opponents also complained that SegWit introduced several new (much more complex) transaction types, which would add 'technical debt' (lots of code you have to keep working later, even if you decide it was a bad idea).  \n",
      "SegWit supporters said the new transactions fixed a problem called 'malleability' (an issue where you can make two transactions with the same transaction ID), and that the new transaction types enable Bitcoin to connect to sidechains (secondary blockchains which would handle daily transactions, while Bitcoin's blockchain is used for overall settlements).  \n",
      "SegWit opponents said that would remove Bitcoin's use as a transactional currency, and force people to use sidechains.  \n",
      "This debate went on for some time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However even if SegWit activated, it wouldn't change consensus rules, so according to Wladimir's policy it did not require full consensus to implement.  Work on SegWit began shortly after it was proposed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "------\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bitcoin Classic**\n",
      "\n",
      "Some months later, Gavin and others came up with a new compromise- Bitcoin Classic.  Classic used the same block percentage signaling activation as XT did, but with a more conservative result- block size would get a one time increase to 2MB.  This was designed to appease miners.  Adoption of Classic started to gain some traction.  However a number of Core developers then flew to China (most major miners are in China) for a meeting, and the result was the 'Hong Kong Roundtable Agreement'.  It basically specified a timeline for when Core would have SegWit code ready for deployment, and a promise that a real block size increase would follow shortly thereafter.  In exchange, miners would stop running Bitcoin Classic.  \n",
      "\n",
      "With some more DDoS attacks on Classic nodes, adoption of Classic ground to a halt.  Classic was essentially dead.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There was more animosity on forums, lots of personal attacks- Core fans said Classic was just a hostile attack / takeover and would push small nodes off the network, Classic fans said Core wanted to logjam Bitcoin for the benefit of Blockstream (a private company that employs several Core developers, and arguably stands to profit from use of sidechains).  \n",

      "**Bitcoin Unlimited**  \n",
      "\n",
      "The next attempt at increasing the block size was in early 2016, called Bitcoin Unlimited.  After several years of this, the idea was 'let's never have this problem ever again, ever'.  Unlimited removes the block size limit from consensus rules entirely, instead making block size limit a user-configurable thing.  To prevent this from causing forks, Unlimited also checks for how popular bigger-than-limit blocks are- if more than X blocks above its set limit are accepted by the network, it will ignore its own setting and accept those blocks.  This process was called *emergent consensus*, as in, the network will collectively decide what the limit should be and a consensus will emerge.  \n",
      "\n",
      "BU had more hostility on both sides, but was gaining traction.  For a while, 30-50% of blocks were supporting BU, much more than were supporting SegWit.  This situation persisted for a several months.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Continued...**\n",
      " Thank you for reminding me about the \"consensus\" argument that the cult also propagated but have since thrown out because it became inconvenient.  Segwit 2x reaches widespread consensus causing segwit activation, Segwit 2x signalling nodes get ignored by Core client.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another fun bs argument they will or have already abandoned: backwards compatible soft fork for those poor full node bitcoin users in Madagascar lol There's a lot of people in this thread that are very caught up in the idea that Bitcoins are this magical unassailable bastion of free money that can never be linked to a person or touched, and I suspect they have their own pro-bitcoin reasons for believing this.  \n",
      "If they're worth as much as you say my advice to to find a different lawyer or at least bring a new one in to consult. Bitcoins 100% fall under the purview of discovery. You need a person who is going to actually go into this and not just dismiss it because she doesn't understand what it is. You need to attempt to get him to give you your half because not only will this attempt to establish the existence of the BTC wallet, even if it's determined to not be a marital asset it can effect how the actual marital assets are divided. And more importantly if he tries to hide them in any of the myriad ways he could, you'll effectively prevent him from spending them or turning them into large sums of cash because the second he does you can go after him again for the money he hid from you.  \n",
      "The thing to remember is that while the legal system doesn't have a lot of precedent on BTC, it has a lot of experience with former spouses trying to hide assets from one another. So many random and valuable intangible assets have been divided up in divorces over the years, don't toss out a potential 150k because this one seems like its a bit legally grey.  It's a shame what's going on. I just spent the last 2 weeks getting non-techies pumped about Bitcoin and buying. Now I have to attempt to explain this shit that I don't fully understand myself.

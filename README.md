# Natural Language Processing for Trending Stocks and Cryptos
## Monash University FinTech Bootcamp Project 2


We want to google trends api to search for trending stocks and crypto 
We want to analyse trending stocks and cryptos in various forums such as news api, reddit and twitter
We also want to analyse previous large price movements and do sentiment analysis on the previous week of data


Methodology
- Find dates where there was a significant price movement on a crypto or stock asset, i.e 10% gain or loss
- Use NLP to analyse previous 30 days keyword trend for the stock or crypto asset or keywords associated with the asset i.e NFT, cross chain, metaverse etc to measure the strength of sentiments on asset/associated keywords before the price movement
- Repeat analysis up to five crypto or stock assets with significant price movements.
- Identify any patterns i.e before the shift in the asset price there was a corresponding increase sentiment on ticker name or assocaiated keyword
- Select new stocks for future predictions and analyse their current trend.
- Make predictions on the future direction of price and estimated percentage change.
